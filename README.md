# Password

Program has two options:

   Option 1. Generates and stores password (if wanted)
   
   option 2. Copies password (if the account exist)
   
Both options are accessed by giving a personal 'Master Password'.

Program uses python's encryption packets to encrypt the encoded password and also decrypting them when copied to the computer. For roperating the password.py, you need a encryption key file. Encryption file consists encryption keys which the program uses. File is generated with encrypt.py program.

This program is not 100% safe and I recomend to uses this program for learning purpose only.
